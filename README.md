## Mall Customer Segmentation

# Overview
This customer segmentation project aims to identify the best customers in a mall by analyzing their demographic and spending data.
The goal is to provide insights to the marketing team and develop effective strategies to target and engage these customers.

# Dataset
Dataset is from Kaggle

# Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

1.Understand the general distribution of customers based on age, income, and spending score.
2.Segment customers based on their age, income, and spending score.
3.Identify the target customers who are most likely to be easily converted and develop strategies to attract and retain them.

# Dependencies
Specify any dependencies or libraries used in the project, such as:

Python 3.7
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Conclusion
1.Marketing cheaper items to women to see if they purchase more frequently or more volume.

2.Marketing more to younger women because their spending score tends to be higher.

3.Thinking up new ways to target advertising, pricing, branding, etc. to the older women (older than early 40s) who have lower spending scores.

4.Figure out a way to gather more data to build a data set that has more features.
  The more features, the better understanding of what determines Spending Score.
  Once Spending Score is better understood, we can understand what factors will lead to increasing Spending Score, thus lead to greater profits.
